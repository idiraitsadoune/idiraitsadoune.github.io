		<li>
			<b>Objective</b> 
			<ul>
				<li>
					Formally annotate numerical variables with measurement units in Event-B.

				<li class="fragment">

			<b>Proposal</b>
			<ul>
				<li class="fragment">
				Develop a measurement units theory using the Theory plugin.

				<li class="fragment">
				Extend the Event-B type-checking system to handle reasoning about measurement units.
