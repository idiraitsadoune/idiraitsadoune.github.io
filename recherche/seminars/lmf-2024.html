The Event-B formal method is an evolution of the classical B method. <br>
It allows the modelling of the behavior of a system by a set of discrete events instead of operations. <br> <br>
This method is based on the notions of pre-conditions and post-conditions of Hoare, <br> 
the weakest pre-condition of Dijkstra, 
and the calculus of substitution developed by JR Abrial for the classical B method. <br> <br>
In addition to the event concept, the Event-B method is based on first-order logic and set theory.

<aside class="notes">
An Event-B model is made of several components of two kinds: machines and contexts. <br>
The machines contain a model's dynamic parts (states and transitions), whereas the contexts contain the static parts
	(axiomatisations and theories). <br>
Another machine can refine a machine, and a context can be extended by another. <br>
Moreover, a machine can see one or several contexts. <br><br>

The following clauses define a context:<br>
The SETS clause describes a set of abstract and enumerated types.<br>
The CONSTANTS clause represents the constants used by a model.<br>
The AXIOMS clause describes, in first-order logic expressions, the properties of the constants defined in the  CONSTANTS  clause. 
Types and constraints are described in this clause.<br>
The THEOREMS are logical expressions that can be deduced from the axioms.<br><br>

Similarly to contexts, a machine is defined by a set of clauses:<br>
The VARIABLES clause represents the state variables of the model. <br>
The INVARIANTS clause describes, by first-order logic expressions, the properties of the variables defined in the  VARIABLES clause. 
Typing information, and functional and safety properties are usually expressed in this clause. These properties need to be preserved by events. <br>
The THEOREMS clause defines a set of logical expressions that can be deduced from the invariants.<br><br>

The EVENTS clause defines all the events that occur in a given model. Each event is characterized by its guard 
and the actions performed when the guard is true. <br><br>
The refinement operation offered by Event-B encodes model decomposition. 
A system is decomposed into another system with more and more design decisions while moving from an abstract level to a concrete one. <br><br>

Proof obligations are associated with any Event-B model. They define the formal semantics associated with each Event-B component. <br>
Briefly, I give a list of the most used or generated PO rules: <br>
these two POs ensure that the proposed theorems of a context or machine are provable.  <br>
this PO ensures that each event preserves each invariant in a machine. <br>
and this last PO ensures that a non-deterministic action is feasible. <br>
There are other rules for generating PO to prove the correctness of variable construction,  the correctness 
of using operators and the correctness of refinement.

<aside class="notes">
To illustrate our approach for extending the Event-B core with the floating-point numbers data type, we propose to model a system 
that continuously calculates a moving object's speed. <br><br>

The proposed Event-B model formalises two functional properties:
PROP~1 specifying that the speed of the moving object is equal to the <i>traveled_distance</i> divided by the <i>measured_time</i>, and <br>
PROP~2 specifying that when the <i>traveled_distance</i> is strictly positive, the <i>speed</i> of the moving object must also 
be strictly positive <br> 
In other words, the object moves when its speed differs from zero. <br><br>

The main objective of this example is to show some modelling and validation problems that we can face when we analyse physical phenomena, 
mainly when we use integer variables to handle small values and expressions that come from the physics laws.

The proposed Event-B model contains two main events : <br><br>

The first event, named <i>get_starting_point</i>, allows the capture of the starting point properties 
of the moving object by initializing the <i>starting_position</i> and <i>starting_time</i> variables. <br><br>

The second event of the proposed Event-B model is called <i>get_speed</i>. <br>
It captures the new position of the moving object and calculates the new values of the <i>measured_time</i>, <i>traveled_distance</i>, 
and <i>speed</i> variables. <br>
These new values depend on the initial position stored in the <i>starting_time</i> and <i>starting_position</i> variables captured

From the model validation point of view, all the POs are green except the one maintaining the <i>@inv7</i> 
invariant by the <i>get_speed</i> event. <br><br>

For recall, this invariant formalises the  PROP~2 property of our system, specifying that 
if the value of the <i>traveled_distance</i> variable is strictly positive, the <i>speed</i> variable must also be strictly positive. <br><br>

However, in the <i>get_speed</i> event, the value of the expression <i>p - starting_position</i> can be less than 
that of <i>t - starting_time</i>. <br>
In this case, the new value of the <i>speed</i> variable becomes equal to zero while the one of the <i>traveled_distance</i> variable is not 
because all variables of our model are integer variables, and the <i>division</i> Event-B operator makes an integer division. <br><br>

For these reasons, this PO cannot be proved.

As known, the floating point is the most used method for representing and approximating real numbers in computer-based arithmetic. <br>
Therefore, we propose to represent real numbers by using floating-point arithmetic. <br>
This approach represents floating-point numbers using an integer called the <i>significand</i>, scaled by an integer <i>exponent</i>
of a fixed <i>base</i>. <br><br>

We have chosen that the <i>base</i> always equals ten in our models. <br>
The proposed theory does not model limited precision floating point numbers. This implies that the operators

In this theory, we have defined a power operator that uses natural exponents. The power operation with natural 
exponents may be expressed with multiplication operations. <br><br>

The definition of exponentiation as an iterated multiplication can be formalized using induction. 
The base case is <i>x^0=1</i> and the recurrence is <i>x^n = x * x^(n-1)</i>.  <br><br>
	
For the case <i>0^0</i>, in contexts where only natural powers are considered, 0 to the power 0 is undefined 
as specified in the  <i>wd</i> <i>condition</i> of the <i>pow</i> operator.<br><br>

The proposed theory also contains some proven theorems formalising some exponent rules like the product rule, 
the power rule, and the multiplying exponents rule.

Let us describe the floating-point numbers theory. <br><br>

The proposed theory formalizes a floating-point number by defining a new data type called <i>FLOAT_Type</i>. 
This new data type provides the <i>NEW_FLOAT</i> 
constructor that allows creating a floating-point number by giving the <i>significand</i> part and the <i>exponent</i> part.<br><br>

Using the <i>NEW_FLOAT</i> constructor, we have defined constants like <i>F0</i> for the value 0 
and <i>F1</i> for the value 1.<br><br>

We have defined a set <i>FLOAT1_Type</i> containing all float numbers that differ from zero.  <br><br>

This theory also provides the <i>FLOAT</i> operator that translates any Event-B integer value into the <i>FLOAT_Type</i>. <br><br>

The floating-point theory redefines all essential numeric operators (comparison and calculation operators), 
and the operator we have to define to overload 
all the numeric operators is the left shift operator. This operator uses a positive offset to perform
	a left shift by multiplying the significand part by powers of ten.<br><br>

To compare two numbers, we left-shift the number containing the biggest exponent to have the same exponent 
as the other number. Then, when two numbers have the same exponents, 
it's possible to compare them by comparing their significand parts. <br><br>

In this way, we have defined the operators (=, >, >=, <, <=) comparing two floating-point numbers.

Using the same reasoning for the comparison, we have generalized the idea to the addition and subtraction operators. 
A left shift of one of the two operands is necessary to perform the addition and subtraction operations. <br><br>

However, the multiplication operation is performed by multiplying the significand parts of the two operands, and the resulting 
exponent is obtained by adding the exponent parts of the two operands. <br><br> 

The <i>f_pow</i> operator generalizes the <i>pow</i> operator for the floating-point numbers.  <br><br> 

Finally, the floating-point data type is often used in laws of physics and scientific calculations. 
Functions calculating the integer part, the fractional part, the floor function and the ceiling function are very useful.

While the proposed theory involves no precision loss for multiplication and addition, division sometimes induces a precision loss. 
For example, we cannot precisely represent the result of 1/3 or 2/3. <br><br>

That is why, for the case of the division and inverse operators, we have first defined the well-defined conditions. <br><br>
To calculate the inverse of x, we must find a z, which we multiply by the significand part of x to obtain a power of ten. 
(The value of z corresponds to the significand part of the result of the inverse of x). <br><br>

For example, to calculate the inverse of 2.5, 4 corresponds to z, which does not exist for the inverse of 3. <br><br>

The same reasoning is done for the division operator.

The only difference is the addition of the invariant concerning the well-definedness condition 
of the division operator used to formalise the speed of the moving object.

The same thing for the <i>get_speed</i> event <br>
Here, we have also the initial event using integers and their associated arithmetic operators. <br><br>

Now, The obtained event is adapted using the equivalent operators from the floating-point numbers theory. <br><br>

As for the INVARIANTS clause, the only difference is the addition of the guard 
concerning the well-definedness condition of the division operator used to calculate the speed of the moving object.

	<aside class="notes">
		From the model validation point of view, contrary to the initial model, all generated proof obligations have been proven. <br><br>

		The problem with the invariant linked to the integer division operator no longer arises. <br>
		The associated PO becomes green, and it has been proven using the interactive prover. 
		As we have said, the <i>@inv8</i> formalises the following property: if the value of the <i>traveled_distance</i> variable 
		is strictly positive, the <i>speed</i> variable must also be strictly positive. 
		Even if in the <i>get_speed</i> event, the value of the <i>traveled_distance</i> can 
		be less than that of <i>measured_time</i>, the new value of the <i>speed</i> variable is never equal to zero because the value 
		of <i>traveled_distance</i>
		is also never equal to zero. All this is possible thanks to the new division operator specification, 
		which acts on the floating-point numbers. 
		<br><br>

		This is one of the reasons that allow us to conclude that our floating-point numbers theory is more suitable 
		than the basic integers of Event-B in modelling hybrid systems and continuous behaviors.

<aside class="notes">
	In this work, we have proposed an approach using the theory plugin to extend the Event-B type-checking 
	system with the possibility of handling floating-point numbers. <br><br>

	We have developed a floating-point numbers theory that formalises a floating-point number using 
	an integer <i>significand</i>, scaled by an integer <i>exponent</i> of a fixed <i>base</i> <br><br> 
	
	Our proposition includes an extension of the Event-B power operator to handle powers of ten more than 0 and 1. <br>
	We have proposed an abstract representation of the floating-point numbers to offer the possibility to refine the proposed 
	theory to any more concrete implementation. <br>
	And finally, the proposed theory contains a set of theorems and associated rewrite and inference rules that 
	can assist developers in the proving activities.

<aside class="notes">
For the next step of our work, we plan to refine the proposed theory to the IEEE standard 754 of floating-point numbers representation. <br><br>

Then, We consider the floating-point numbers theory the first step before developing a more general theory that will 
formalise the standard units of measurement defined by the International System of Units. <br>
I think that such theories will help many Event-B developers to model cyber-physical systems using the Event-B formal method.
