    Introduction

<p class="text-justify">
  We will keep the same choices for this processor as for the course machine: Von Neumann architecture, 
  16-bit words and addresses. Instead of an accumulator, two registers (denoted AC0 and AC1) are available; 
  data exchanges between the main memory (RAM) and the processor (accumulators) 
  are carried out with the LDR0, LDR1, and STR0 instructions.

  Generic data path

<ul>
  <li>ALU : Arithmetic and Logic Unit</li>
  <li>ALUC : Arithmetic and Logic Unit command</li>
  <li>IR : Instruction register</li>
  <li>PP : Program pointer register</li>
  <li>AC0 : Accumulator register 0</li>
  <li>AC1 : Accumulator register 1</li>
  <li>ADMR : Memory Address register</li>

  <li>MO : Memory Output register</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-justify">
  The data path that will serve as the basis for the processor's design follows that of the course machine
   by replacing the accumulator register with two registers (AC0 and AC1). 
   The program pointer register (PP) clock (HPP) loads the PP register if the CPP signal equals one and increments it otherwise.
   The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is assumed to have all the necessary operations.
