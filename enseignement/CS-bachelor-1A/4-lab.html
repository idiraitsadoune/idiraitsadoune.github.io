    The objective is to create a simple 16-bit accumulator machine with the following characteristics:
    <ul>
        <li>operands are 16-bit integers</li>
        <li>addresses are 12 bits</li>
        <li>the instructions are 16-bit words with three fields: <br>

           <ul>
            <li>the most significant bit (bit 15) indicates the addressing mode. Its meaning is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>0 : <b>Immediate</b> (called direct for jumps): The argument is the operand.</li>
                    <li>1 : <b>Indirect</b>: The argument is the address of the address of the operand.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>bits 12 to 14 indicate the operation to be performed:

    Elements provided for the study
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    Logisim is free software suitable for simulating logic, combinatorial and sequential circuits. 
    In particular, it lends itself well to the creation of small computers. 
    Logisim has numerous components as standard, adding a library of components produced at CentraleSupelec 
    called ESE1010, which notably includes an arithmetic and logic unit (UAL) and a sequencer.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The kit used for this study is a ZIP archive in which you will find, once unzipped:
    <ul>
        <li>the <cs-code>logisim-2.7.1.jar</cs-code>  file, which is the Logisim simulator.</li>
        <li>the <cs-code>ese1010.jar</cs-code> file, which is the library of Logisim components necessary to carry out the study</li>
        <li>the <cs-code>ese1010.circ</cs-code> file, which contains the described computer skeleton</li>
        <li>The test files <cs-code>test_unit.mem</cs-code> and <cs-code>test_fct.mem</cs-code> contain the two test programs described 
            below and must be loaded into the memory component. </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <img src="./img/schema.png" alt="">

    <br>
    The skeleton of the computer is equipped with a clock component. To start the simulation, 
    all you have to do is activate it in the Simulate menu. Check that:
    <ul>
        <li>Simulation Enabled is checked;</li>
        <li>Ticks Enabled is checked;</li>
        <li>In Tick Frequency, choose a frequency that is not too high (e.g. 8Hz) to start.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
The “top” part of the diagram includes 8 generic control signals, initially called C1 to C8 on the sequencer. 
You will use these signals to control controlled switches.

<br><br>
The “lower” part of the diagram contains control signals to the data path elements. Their meaning - which can 
be deduced from an examination of the diagram - is recalled below:
<ul>
<li> HCO: clock of the ordinal counter register (CO);</li>   
<li> CCO: CO loading: determines what is loaded in the CO when HCO is activited: if 0, CO + 1; if 1, CO input;</li>
<li> HAQ: accumulator register clock (AQ);</li>
<li> HRADM: Memory Address Register Clock (RADM);</li>
<li> HEM: clock of the memory input register (EM), which is loaded from the value located at the input of connector D (“from the bottom”);</li>
<li> RW: positions the memory for reading (RW=1) or writing (RW=0). When reading, the value located at the address given by the RADM is available 
    at the output on connector D (“upwards”). In writing, the value present in the EM register is written to the address given by the RADM;</li>

<li> HRI: instruction register (RI) clock;</li>
<li> Sext: control of the extension sign for the 12 least significant bits of the RI (argument part) to 16 bits (extension if Sext = 1).</li>
<li> U0 to U3: UAL command, 
<br>

<div><b>
    1 - Timetable and equations

<p class="text-justify">
    <ul>
        <li>From the provided schema, determine the data path and timetable for executing all operations (and complete the microprocessor schema).</li>
        <li>From the obtained timetable, write signal equations to be used by the sequencer.</li>

    Two test programs are provided as files to load into the memory component.

<p class="text-justify">
    The first ( <cs-code>test_unit.mem</cs-code> ) tests each instruction according to the two addressing modes. 
    Lines labelled ERROR should not be executed by the designed processor.

    It's up to you to determine what the second one (<cs-code>test_fct.mem</cs-code>)
