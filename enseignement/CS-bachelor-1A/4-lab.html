  Description of the processor to be made. 
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
  This lab session aims to design a simple processor using <b>Logisim software</b> (see below). 
  More precisely, we aim to create a simple 16-bit accumulator machine with the following characteristics:
  <ul>
    <li>operands are 16-bit integers</li>
    <li>addresses are 12 bits</li>
    <li>the instructions are 16-bit words with three fields: <br>
      <img src="./img/operation.svg" width="50%" alt="" style="margin: 10px ;">
      <ul>
        <li>the most significant bit (bit 15) indicates the addressing mode:
          <ul>
            <li>0 (<b>Immediate</b>): the argument contains the operand value.</li>
            <li>1 (<b>Indirect</b>): the argument contains the address of the address of the operand value.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>bits 12 to 14 indicate the operation to be performed:

        <li>the least significant 12 bits contain the operation's argument (value or address).</li>

      Since the CLR instruction has no argument (implicit addressing mode), only the bits 12 to 14 are decoded.

<h2>
  Elements provided for the study
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  Logisim is free software suitable for simulating logic, combinatorial and sequential circuits. 
  In particular, it lends itself well to the creation of small computers. 
  Logisim has numerous components as standard, adding a library of components produced 
  at CentraleSupelec called ESE1010, which notably includes an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) and a Control Unit.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
  The kit used for this lab session is a ZIP archive containing (once unzipped):
  <ul>
    <li><b>the <cs-code>logisim-2.7.1.jar</cs-code> file</b>: the Logisim simulator.</li>
    <li><b>the <cs-code>ese1010.jar</cs-code> file</b>: the library of Logisim components.</li>
    <li><b>the <cs-code>ese1010.circ</cs-code> file</b>: contains the described computer skeleton.</li>
    <li><b>the test files <cs-code>test_unit.mem</cs-code> and <cs-code>test_fct.mem</cs-code></b>: 
      two test programs described below. </li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <div>
    <img src="./img/schema.png" alt="" width="100%">
  </div>
  
  
The “top” part of the diagram includes 8 generic control signals called C1 to C8. 
You can use these signals to control the contolled buffer components.

<br><br>
The main part of the diagram contains control signals of the data path elements. Their meaning is given below:
  <ul>
    <li> PCC: the program counter register command (PC register);</li>   
    <li> CC command: determines what is loaded in the PC register when PCC is activited: 0 $\to$ (PC + 1); 1 $\to$ (PC register input);</li>
    <li> AccC: Accumulator register command (Acc register);</li>
    <li> MARC: Memory Address Register command (MAR register);</li>
    <li> IMC: the memory input command (MI);</li>
    <li> RW: the memory command (for reading RW=1 or writing RW=0). <br>
      When reading command, the memory word 
      located at the address given by the MAR register is available 
      at the output memory (OM). In writing command, the value of the memory input (MI) 
      is written to the address given by the MAR register;</li>

    <li> IRC: Instruction register command (IR register) <command>;</li>
    <li> Sext: control of the extension sign for the 12 least significant bits of the IR register (argument part) 
      to 16 bits (extension if Sext = 1).</li>
    <li> U0 to U3: ALU command, 
      <br>
      <img src="./img/ual-code.png" alt="" width="350px">
    </li>
  </ul>

  Work to be done
</div>

<h2>
  1 - Timetable and equations
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  <ul>
    <li>Determine the data path and timetable for executing all operations (and complete the microprocessor schema).</li>
    <li>Write signal equations to be used by the Control Unit.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>
  2 - Implementation
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  <ul>
    <li>Using Logisim simulator, write the obtained equations into the Control Unit component.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>
  3 - Tests
</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  The skeleton of the computer is equipped with a clock component. To start the simulation, 
  you must activate it in the Simulate menu. Check that:
  <ul>
    <li>Simulation Enabled is checked;</li>
    <li>Ticks Enabled is checked;</li>
    <li>In Tick Frequency, choose a frequency that is not too high (e.g. 8Hz) to start.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
  Two test programs are provided as files. To use one of them, you need to load it into the memory component.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
  The first program file ( <cs-code>test_unit.mem</cs-code> ) tests each instruction according to the two addressing modes. 
  Lines labelled ERROR should not be executed by the designed processor. 
</p>

<img src="./img/test1.png" alt="">

<p class="text-justify">
  If the test program is correctly executed, you can now execute the second program (<cs-code>test_fct.mem</cs-code>) 
  and determine what it does and whether the obtained result is correct:
