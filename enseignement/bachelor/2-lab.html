    The objective is to create a simple 16-bit accumulator machine with the following characteristics:
    <ul>
        <li>operands are 16-bit integers</li>
        <li>addresses are 12 bits</li>
        <li>the instructions are 16-bit words with three fields: <br>

           <ul>
            <li>the most significant bit (bit 15) indicates the addressing mode. Its meaning is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>0 : Immediate (called direct for jumps): The argument is the operand.</li>
                    <li>1 : Indirect: The argument is the address of the address of the operand.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>bits 12 to 14 indicate the operation to be performed:

    Data path
</b></div>

<br>
<img src="./img/schema.png" alt="">

<p class="text-justify">
    From the generic data path provided, determine the data path specific to the requested processor.
<br>
It is advisable to create a timetable showing the transfer requirements between modules for all instructions 
and the two addressing modes, if applicable, without deciding which argument bus (A1 or A2) or which result bus 
(R1 or R2) is used. Once this table is complete, the exact choice of bus used can be made by seeking to minimize 
the number of connections controlled by the sequencer.
<br>
In addition to this timetable, the result of this step must be materialized in the form of a diagram 
of the specific data path on which appear the switches which are either always closed or sometimes 
closed and sometimes open (the always open switches are not shown in the diagram). 
Present your data path to the supervisor before continuing.

    Elements provided for the study
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
    Logisim is free software suitable for simulating logic, combinatorial and sequential circuits. 
    In particular, it lends itself well to the creation of small computers. 
    Logisim has numerous components as standard, adding a library of components produced at CentraleSupelec 
    called ESE1010, which notably includes an arithmetic and logic unit (UAL) and a sequencer.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    The kit used for this study is a ZIP archive in which you will find, once unzipped:
    <ul>
        <li>the <code>logisim-2.7.1.jar</code>  file, which is the Logisim simulator.</li>
        <li>the <code>ese1010.jar</code> file, which is the library of Logisim components necessary to carry out the study</li>
        <li>the <code>ese1010.circ</code> file, which contains the described computer skeleton</li>
        <li>The test files <code>test_unit.mem</code> and <code>test_fct.mem</code> contain the two test programs described above and must be loaded into the memory component. </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    The skeleton of the computer is equipped with a clock component. To start the simulation, 
    all you have to do is activate it in the Simulate menu. Check that:
    <ul>
        <li>Simulation Enabled is checked;</li>
        <li>Ticks Enabled is checked;</li>
        <li>In Tick Frequency, choose a frequency that is not too high (e.g. 8Hz) to start.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
The “top” part of the diagram includes 8 generic control signals, initially called C1 to C8 on the sequencer. 
You will use these signals to control controlled switches.

<br><br>
The “lower” part of the diagram contains control signals to the data path elements. Their meaning - which can 
be deduced from an examination of the diagram - is recalled below:
<ul>
<li> HCO: clock of the ordinal counter register (CO);</li>   
<li> CCO: CO loading: determines what is loaded in the CO when a rising edge is applied to HCO: if 0, CO + 1; if 1, CO entry;</li>
<li> HAQ: accumulator register clock (AQ);</li>
<li> HRADM: Memory Address Register Clock (RADM);</li>
<li> HEM: clock of the memory input register (EM), which is loaded from the value located at the input of connector D (“from the bottom”);</li>
<li> RW: positions the memory for reading (RW=1) or writing (RW=0). When reading, the value located at the address given by the RADM is available at the output on connector D (“upwards”). In writing, the value present in the EM register is written to the address given by the RADM;</li>

<li> HRI: instruction register (RI) clock;</li>
<li> Sext: control of the extension sign for the 12 least significant bits of the RI (argument part) to 16 bits (extension if Sext = 1).</li>
<li> U0 to U3: UAL command,
