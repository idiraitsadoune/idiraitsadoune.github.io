    Exercise 1 : Multiprogramming with paging
</div>
<p class="text-justify">
    In a paging system, one page contains 256 words of memory and each process is allowed to use at most 4 frames of main memory. 
    We consider the following page table of process P1: 
</p>

<table style="text-align: center;">
    <thead >
      <tr>
        <th ><b>Page</b></th>
        <th >000</th>
        <th >001</th>
        <th >010</th>
        <th >011</th>
        <th >100</th>
        <th >101</th>
        <th >110</th>
        <th >111</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td ><b>Frame</b></td>
            <td >011</td>
            <td >-</td>
            <td >000</td>
            <td >-</td>
            <td >-</td>

  <ol style="padding-top: 20px;">
    <li>How ample is the address space of process P1?</li>
    <li>How much RAM does this system have? </li>
    <li>Calculate the real addresses corresponding to the following virtual addresses (you will possibly report addressing errors). 
        <ul><li>(00011110000)$_2$, (01000100010)$_2$, (62A)$_{16}$, (818)$_{16}$</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>What happens if P1 uses virtual address (302)$_{16}$?</li>
    <li>We consider the following virtual address: 0000 0000 0000 0111. Knowing that the 4 most significant bits designate the page number 
        and that the next 12 bits represent the offset in the page, give the physical address (expressed in binary) corresponding to this address.</li>
