    Description du problème : Système producteurs - consommateurs
</div>

<p class="text-justify">
<ul>
    <li>On considère un ensemble de <cs-code>P producteurs</cs-code> et <ccs-code>C consommateurs</cs-code>, 
        communiquant par des messages 
        de longueur fixe à travers une zone de mémoire partagée (<b>boîte à lettres</b>) gérée en  <b>FIFO</b> par un <b>serveur</b>. 
        Les producteurs y déposent des messages ; les consommateurs en retirent (ou extraient) des messages.
    </li>

    <li style="padding-top: 20px;">
        Cette boîte à lettres est réalisée à l’aide d’un <b>tableau circulaire</b> de taille <cs-code>N</cs-code>, 
        noté <cs-code>boiteALettre</cs-code>. 
        Chaque élément de ce tableau est susceptible de contenir un <b>message</b> de type <cs-code>Integer</cs-code>.
    </li>

    <li style="padding-top: 20px;">
        On désignera par <cs-code>finDepot</cs-code> (resp. <cs-code>debutRetrait</cs-code>) 
        l’indice dans ce tableau de la prochaine place libre pour un dépôt
        (resp. du prochain message à extraire). <cs-code>finDepot</cs-code> et <cs-code>debutRetrait</cs-code> 
        sont initialisés à <cs-code>0</cs-code> 
        et sont incrémentés (modulo <cs-code>N</cs-code>) après chaque opération de dépôt (resp. retrait).
    </li>

    <li style="padding-top: 20px;">
        Les protocoles à mettre en œuvre doivent garantir :
        <ol>
            <li>
                qu’un producteur se bloque quand il tente de déposer un message dans une boîte à lettres pleine ;
            </li>
            <li>
                qu’il est réactivé dès que de la place devient libre (c’est-à-dire dès qu’un consommateur a prélevé un message) ;
            </li>
            <li>
                que plusieurs producteurs tentant de déposer simultanément des messages n’utilisent pas la même place dans la boîte à lettres ;
            </li>
            <li>
                que le fonctionnement symétrique est garanti pour les consommateurs ;
            </li>
            <li>
                qu’un consommateur ne peut prélever un message qu’une fois son dépôt, par le producteur, terminé.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

    En utilisant les différents outils vus en cours, proposez une solution en \mcg{Java} qui implémente
