          Au coeur de la prise en charge du réseau en <b>Java</b> se trouve le concept de <b>socket</b>.<br>

          Une <b>Socket</b> permet à un seul ordinateur de servir <i>plusieurs clients</i>

        </li>
        <li class="fragment skip">
          Cela est accompli grâce à l'utilisation d'un <i>port</i>, qui est une socket numéroté sur une machine particulière. 
            <ul id="fleche"><li>on dit qu'un processus serveur <i>écoute un port</i> jusqu'à ce qu'un client s'y connecte. </li></ul>
        </li>
        <li class="fragment skip">
          Un serveur est autorisé <i>à accepter plusieurs clients connectés</i> au même numéro de port, bien que chaque session soit unique.
