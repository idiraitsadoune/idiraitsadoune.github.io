	<h2>Why an Approximation?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>These events are approximations for <b>two reasons</b>:
            <ol>
                <li class="fragment">They might be <b>refined</b>  (made more precise) later</li>
                <li class="fragment">They might be <b>insufficient</b> at this stage because <b>not consistent <br>
                    with the invariant</b> </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li class="fragment skip">We have to perform a <b>proof</b> in order to <b>verify this consistency</b>.</li>

	<h2>Invariants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An invariant is a <b>constraint</b>  on the allowed values of the variables</li>

        <li class="skip">An invariant <b>must hold on all reachable states</b>  of a model</li>

        <li class="skip">To verify that this holds we must show that
            <ol>
                <li>the invariant holds for <b>initial states</b>, and</li>
                <li>the invariant is <b>preserved by all events</b> </li>
            </ol>

        </li>

        <li class="skip">We will formalize these two statements as <b>proof obligations (POs)</b> </li>

        <li class="skip">We need a <b>rigorous proof</b>  showing that these POs indeed hold</li>

	<h2>Before-after Predicates</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>To each event can be associated a <b>before-after predicate</b></li>

        <li class="skip">It describes the <b>relation</b>  between the <b>values</b>  of the variable(s) <br> 
           <b>just before</b> and <b>just after</b> the event occurrence</li>

        <li class="skip">The <b>before-value</b> is denoted by the <b>variable name</b>, say <code class="listing">$n$</code> </li>
