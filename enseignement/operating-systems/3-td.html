    Exercice 1 : Barrière de synchronisation
</div>
<p>
    On suppose dans un premier temps que l’on ne traite que 2 threads. Ces threads obéissent au modèle suivant :
</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 10%;"></div>

<div style="width: 35%;" class="highlight">
<pre>
<b>Thread_1</b>
<span class="kd">While</span> (<span class="mf">true</span>) <span class="kd">do</span>
    calcul_1();
    barriere_1();
<span class="kd">end</span>
</pre></div>

<div style="width: 35%;" class="highlight">
<pre>
<b>Thread_2</b>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>En utilisant 2 sémaphores, dont vous préciserez les valeurs initiales, écrivez le pseudo-code des fonctions 
            <code>barriere_1()</code> <br> et <code>barriere_2()</code>, qui doivent être telles que le <b>Thread_1</b> ne sort de 
            <code>barriere_1()</code> que lorsque le <b>Thread_2</b> a atteint <code>barriere_2()</code> <br>
            (et réciproquement).</li>
        
        <li>Généralisez au cas de <code>N</code> threads</li>
        
        <li>Proposez une autre solution, dans laquelle un thread auxiliaire (coordinateur) reçoit un signal quand le <b>Thread_i</b> 
            atteint sa barrière, et débloque les <code>N</code> threads en attente lorsque tous se sont présentés à leur barrière. </li>

    Exercice 2 - Gestion de véhicules dans un  tunnel
</div>
<p>
    Une route joignant la France à l’Espagne utilise un tunnel à voie unique. En utilisant des sémaphores, 
    vous allez synchroniser les véhicules de manière qu’à tout instant, tous les véhicules circulent dans le même sens.
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>On supposera dans un premier temps que le tunnel peut contenir un nombre quelconque de véhicules, 
            et on tolère les attentes infinies.</li>
        <li>Modifiez votre solution de manière à garantir que, à un instant donné, au plus <code>4</code> véhicules 
            (dans la même direction) sont sur le tunnel.</li>
        <li>Comment faire en sorte que les véhicules joignant la France (resp. L'Espagne) ne monopolisent pas le tunnel?</li>

    Exercice 3 - Diffusion de messages
</div>
<p>
    On considère un système à <code>1</code> producteur et <code>C</code> consommateurs partageant une boîte à lettres pouvant contenir <code>N</code> messages. 
    Le producteur dépose les messages dans la boîte à lettres, et les consommateurs les y récupèrent. Chaque message déposé (une fois) 
    par le producteur doit être lu par les <code>C</code> consommateurs. On impose également que les consommateurs reçoivent les messages 
    dans l’ordre où ils ont été déposés. Il faut noter que les consommateurs ne sont pas synchronisés, et que, par exemple, 
    un consommateur rapide peut avoir lu jusqu’à <code>N</code> messages de plus qu’un consommateur plus lent.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Développez une solution à ce problème, c’est-à-dire une description du processus producteur et des processus consommateurs qui respectent 
            les spécifications. Cette solution devra utiliser des sémaphores dont le rôle sera explicité.</li>

Vous pouvez introduire toute structure de données qui vous paraît utile, sous réserve de la décrire précisément et de la justifier.
