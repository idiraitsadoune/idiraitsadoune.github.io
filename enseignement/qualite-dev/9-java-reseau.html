            At the core of <b>Java</b>’s networking support is the concept of a <b>socket</b>. <br>

        </li>

        <li class="fragment skip">
            <b>Socket</b> allows a single computer to serve many <i>different
                clients</i><br> at once, as well as to serve many <i>different types of information</i>. 
        </li>
        <li class="fragment skip">
            This is accomplished through the use of a <i>port</i>, which is a numbered socket on a particular machine. 
            <ul id="fleche"><li>A server process is said to <i>listen</i> to a port until a client connects to it. </li></ul>

            A server is allowed to <i>accept multiple clients connected to the same port number</i>, although each session is unique.
