    Exercice 1 : Le nombre secret
</div>

<p>
    Nous souhaitons développer avec <b>Java</b> un jeu sur réseau basé sur une architecture <b>Client/Serveur</b>.  
    Le but du jeu est de permettre à deux joueurs de s'affronter en ligne.
</p>
<div class="subsection-title">
	Déroulement d'un partie du jeu
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Le <code class="listing">Serveur</code> commence par générer un nombre aléatoire entre <code class="listing">0</code> et <code class="listing">100</code>.</li>

    <li>Le <code class="listing">Serveur</code> attend que deux joueurs (<code class="listing">Clients</code>) se connectent.</li>

    <li>Une fois que les deux joueurs sont connectés, le serveur leurs envoie un message <code class="listing">"GO"</code> pour leur permettre de commencer le jeu.</li>

    <li>Chaque joueur va essayer de trouver le nombre aléatoire généré par le <code class="listing">Serveur</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>Le joueur envoie un nombre au serveur</li>
            <li>Le serveur répond par : <code class="listing">"plus grand"</code>, <code class="listing">"plus petit"</code>, ou <code class="listing">"trouvé"</code>.</li>
        </ul>
	</li>

    <li>
        A la fin du jeu (les deux joueurs ont réussi à trouver le nombre aléatoire généré par le serveur), 
        les deux joueurs reçoivent un message de la part du serveur contenant le nombre de tentatives et <code class="listing">"Vous avez gagné"</code> 
        si le joueur a réussi à trouver le nombre caché avec moins de tentatives que son adversaire, <code class="listing">"Vous avez perdu"</code> sinon.
    </li>
</ul>

    Proposez une solution en utilisant le langage <b>Java</b> et en faisant appel aux différentes notions 
    vues en cours (La programmation concurrente, La programmation de protocoles Clients/Serveurs, ...)

    Exercice 2 : Gestion des profiles des clients
</div>
<p>
    Une entreprise souhaite sauvegarder les profiles des clients qui se connectent sur son serveur. Pour cela,
le protocole suivant a été implémenté : 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A chaque connexion sur le serveur, le client envoie les informations suivantes au serveur :
        <ul>
           <li>Le nom du client</li>  
           <li>L'adresse IP du client</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Le code <code class="listing">Java</code> suivant permet de collecter le nom et l'adresse IP d'une machine :
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java"><script type="text/template">import java.net.*;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			InetAddress localMachine = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
			System.out.println(localMachine.getHostName());
			System.out.println(localMachine.getHostAddress());
		} catch (UnknownHostException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}                             
</script></code></pre>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>à chaque connexion d'un client, un thread est lancé pour collecter les informations envoyées.</li>
		<li>Après reception des informations, elles sont stockées dans une liste gérée par le serveur et un message <code class="listing">"ACK"</code> est envoyé au client.</li>
		<li>Après la réception du message <code class="listing">"ACK"</code> par le client, il renvoie à son tour un message <code class="listing">"ACK"</code> au Thread du Serveur qui peut s'arrêter.</li>
		</ul>
