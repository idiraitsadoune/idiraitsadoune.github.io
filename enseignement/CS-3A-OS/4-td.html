    Exercice 4 : Segmentation paginée
</div>
<p>
    On considère un système avec une mémoire virtuelle segmentée paginée où la taille d’une
    page est de 4Ko et une mémoire physique de 64Ko. L’espace d’adressage d’un processus P est
    composé de trois segments S1, S2 et S3 de taille, respectivement 16Ko, 8Ko et 4Ko. À un moment
    donné, pour le processus P, les pages 2 et 3 du segment S1, la page 2 du segment S2 et la page 1 du
    segment S3 sont chargées en mémoire physique, respectivement dans les cases 2, 0, 9, 12.  
</p>
<p>
    Pour une donnée située dans l’espace d’adressage du processus P à l’adresse décimale 8212,
indiquez :
</p>

<ol>
    <li> le segment </li>
    <li> le numéro de page dans le segment</li>
    <li> le déplacement dans la page</li>
    <li> le numéro de case</li>
    <li> le déplacement dans la case</li>
    <li> l’adresse physique (en décimal et en binaire)  </li>
</ol>

<!-- CORRECTION ################# -->
<div class="green-block">
<img src="./img/td_4_q4.png" alt=""> <br>
8212 = 2 *4096 + 20 avec 4 Ko = 1024 * 4 = 4096<br>
segment = S1<br>
page = 3<br>
déplacement = 20<br>
cadre = 0<br>
déplacement = 20<br>
l’adresse physique est donc 20 en décimal. L’adresse physique est exprimée sur 16 bits (64Ko =
$2^{16}$), dont 4 bits pour le numéro de cadre et 12 bits pour le déplacement dans la case (4Ko = $2^{12}$ ) , ce
qui nous donne en binaire 0000 0000 0001 0100.<br>
